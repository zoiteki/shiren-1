# Shiren the Wanderer Wiki

A site for housing information and strategies for Mystery Dungeon 2: Shiren the Wanderer for the
Super Famicom. The information housed here is specific for the Super Famicom version, and cannot be
used for the DS/Mobile ports of Shiren the Wanderer. Information about the DS version can be found
at <https://github.com/SharkSnack/shiren-ds1>.

This wiki uses the same terminology as the Fan Translation by Aeon Genesis:
<https://www.romhacking.net/translations/483/> but information can be applied to any version of
Shiren the Wanderer (SFC).

The base of the site is the same as [SharkSnacks's](https://github.com/SharkSnack) other Shiren
guides. It is built with Gatsby and published to GitHub Pages. It can be built locally if you have
Node/NPM installed.

```sh
npm install
npm run develop
```
