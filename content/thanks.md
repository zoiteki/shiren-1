## Thanks

List of people that deserve some thanks.

- [SharkSnack's](https://github.com/SharkSnack)
  - Has several other Shiren the Wanderer guides that are all extremely well documented.
  It gave me something to shoot for! I used the same format and styling so anyone
  familiar with his great work would feel familiar with this guide.
- Maintainers of the [SFC シレンwiki](https://seesaawiki.jp/shiren1/)
  - Over the years they have extensively documented this game very well
- オヤジ戦車: "Oyaji Tank"
  - Oyaji Tank has provided all the data needed to create monster stats, tables,
  rates here: <https://oyasen20.tripod.com/>
- [dot_lvl](https://dot-lvl.bsky.social)
  - My friend dot got me into Shiren. I wouldn't have put this guide together if
  it wasn't for her
