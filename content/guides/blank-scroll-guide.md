Reading a Blank Scroll without first writing on it with the Scribe command will result in nothing
and a very helpful message:  
"But the scroll was blank".

You can write up to 8 letters on a Blank Scroll, but only the ones listed below will have an effect.
If you attempt to write anything else a message will be read:  
"___ ...vainly echoed."

*Monster House Scroll has multiple entries. In the original Japanese version, there are multiple
ways to Scribe it, and the same functionality carried over in the Fan Translation.

`モンスターハウスの巻物` can be scribed:

- `もんすた`  
- `もんすたー`  
- `もんすたーは`  
- `もんすたはう`  
- `はうす`

This is likely because Monster House Scroll is written using Katakana, but the Japanese scribe
system only allowed for writing in Hiragana. So Chunsoft accepted several
variations of Monster House probably to avoid user error.

#### Unobtainable Scrolls

There are two scrolls that are unobtainable, and their effects can only be realized via the Blank
Scroll.
