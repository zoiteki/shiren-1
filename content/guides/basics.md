## Items

Shiren does not have any innate abilities, he can move, attack, and use [items](../items/). Other than
equipment, all items have limited usage - Shiren is a game about managing your items!

### Equipment

Straightforward: [Swords](../items/weapons) increase Attack. [Shields](../items/shields) increase Defense.
[Bracers](../items/bracers) give a passive effect. [Arrows](../items/arrows) can be fired with the L
button or from the menu. You can only have one of each equipped.
