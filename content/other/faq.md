## What is Mystery Dungeon?

Mystery Dungeon is a series of roguelike games developed by Chunsoft / Spike Chunsoft. The series
began with Torneko's Great Adventure: Mystery Dungeon, featuring Torneko from Dragon Quest 4. Shiren
the Wanderer is the 2nd entry in the series, departing from the Dragon Quest universe. Many people
outside of Japan are familiar with various titles in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series, but Mystery
Dungeon also includes Chocobo Dungeon, Etrian Mystery Dungeon, as well as several other Dragon Quest
related Mystery Dungeon series. It is quite popular in Japan!

Mystery Dungeon are games similar to rogue (being a "true roguelike"), featuring Dungeon Crawling,
Tile base movement, Turn-based, and RPG-mechanics such as equipment, Defeating Monsters for EXP,
Items, Equipment.

Every time you step into the dungeon, if you die, you are sent back to the start with no inventory.
Shiren the Wanderer does not feature much "meta-progression". The only thing you can keep with you
is the knowledge you gained from your attempts. However, some Dungeons in the Mystery Dungeon series
allow you to bring items that you've previously obtained into the Dungeon.
