// In Development

This guide specifically covers information for Mystery Dungeon 2: Shiren the Wanderer for the Super
Famicom. There are pretty significant differences between the two, and there wasn't an English
resource available.

## List of Known Differences

In Development

#### New Dungeons

The DS version added new dungeons

#### New Monsters

- New monster types have been added. e.g. Tiger Uho / Tiger Thrower is new in DS
  - Parthenos, which was included in the game but went unused exists in DS
- Most enemies have 4 levels. Even Monsters that only had a single level now have
  4 levels. Healer Rabbit still only has 1 level (Fluffy Bunny in DS)

#### Changes to existing Monsters

Existing monster types have been altered. Different HP, Attack, Defense, EXP rewards for most
monsters

One frustrating example is the ![Chicken](../images/monsters/chicken_1.png) Chicken awards only 1
experience instead of 200, making attempts at defeating a ![Master
Chicken](../images/monsters/chicken_2.png) Master Chicken usually result in getting no reward.

#### Changes to existing Dungeons

While the existing dungeons have the same flow (e.g. Table Mountain is still 30 Floors), the Monster
table and Item Table for the dungeon has been altered. Not only have the new enemies been added in,
but shuffled around existing enemies.

#### Damage Calculations

The damage Calculations are different. In terms of calculating damage on a 0 defense target, the
games seem to be roughly equivalent.

In Shiren SFC, Defense / Shield Strength had an exponential relationship with the damage  
DMG = ATK*(15/16)^DEF

In Shiren DS, it **feels** less pronounced, almost linear (I don't have extensive knowledge so I'm
not sure).

#### New Items
